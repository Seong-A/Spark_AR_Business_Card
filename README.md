### Spark_AR
#### This filter is a trendy business card suitable for the self-PR era using Target Tracker. 
#### When the user's face appears on the front camera, a message changes the direction of the camera appears.
#### And when the rear camera displays a paper business card or a mobile business card, an AR object comes out to promote the business card owner.
